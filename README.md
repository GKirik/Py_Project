#Py_Project
Py_Project helps users design and analyze microstrip patch antennas. It simplifies the process of determining essential antenna characteristics based on desired specifications, providing a convenient way to calculate and visualize key parameters for optimal performance. 
**Antenna Parameter Calculation**: Calculates key parameters of a microstrip patch antenna, including patch width, length, effective permittivity, and feed position, based on user-provided input such as resonant frequency, substrate permittivity, and height. 
**Input Validation**: Validates user input to ensure it falls within acceptable ranges and data types (e.g., numeric values for frequency, permittivity, and height).  Provides error messages for invalid input.
**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter for inputting antenna parameters and displaying calculated results. Includes a visual representation of the antenna structure.
**Result Display**: Displays calculated antenna parameters in a clear and organized manner within the GUI, including units for each parameter.
**Formula Implementation**: Implements the precise formulas for calculating microstrip patch antenna parameters, ensuring accurate results based on electromagnetic theory. 
**Integration with Scientific Libraries**: Utilizes scientific computing libraries like NumPy and SciPy for numerical calculations and integration, enabling accurate and efficient computation of antenna parameters.
